abstract: "We introduce NightPulse, an interactive tool for Night-time light (NTL) data visualization and analytics, which enables researchers and stakeholders to explore and analyze NTL data with a user-friendly platform. Powered by efficient system architecture, NightPulse supports image segmentation, clustering, and change pattern detection to identify urban development and sprawl patterns. It captures temporal trends of NTL and semantics of cities, answering questions about demographic factors, city boundaries, and unusual differences"
