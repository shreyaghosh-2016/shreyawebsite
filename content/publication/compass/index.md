summary: This study explores the complex relationship between elephants and their environment, emphasizing its significance for ecology and conservation strategies. The research focuses on understanding elephant movement in Sub-Saharan Africa, considering ecological factors like seasons and rainfall patterns. Despite the challenges, the study offers valuable insights into elephant migratory behavior within the dynamic African landscape. By predicting how ecological determinants impact elephant migration, the research aids in informed conservation strategies, especially considering climate change effects on the environment. The findings contribute to minimizing human-elephant conflict, managing land use, and improving anti-poaching efforts for sustainable coexistence in the region.
