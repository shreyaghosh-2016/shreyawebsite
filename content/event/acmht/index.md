summary: "Catching Lies in the Act: A Framework for Misinformation Detection on Social Media"
abstract: "The proliferation of social media has intensified the necessity for

automated misinformation detection. Existing methods often strug-
gle with early detection, as key information is not readily available

during the initial dissemination stages. In this paper, we introduce a
novel model for early misinformation detection on social media by
classifying information propagation paths and leveraging linguistic
patterns. Our model incorporates a causal user attribute inference
model to label users as potential misinformation propagators or
believers. Designed for early detection, the model includes two

auxiliary tasks: forecasting the scope of misinformation dissemina-
tion and clustering similar nodes (users) based on their attributes

outperforming the current state-of-the-art benchmarks."
